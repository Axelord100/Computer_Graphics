# Computer_Graphics

This is the course taken at ITAM Fall 2022, here I'll upload both homeworks and projects done. 

In this class we used the langugage of C and C++ for it to be implemented in OpenGL.

Since the course was taken in spanish, most of the comments or codes with have many parts in spanish.
